# lenga

This repository contains scripts and files aimed at improving and annotating de novo RNA-seq assemblies

- lenga.zip contains an initialization file that the researcher must complete with paths to input files and binaries.
  The structure of the zipped file must be conserved (a common directory containing all files and the scripts/ directory).
  Once the lenga.ini file has been correctly completed, lenga.py can be called in its directory with python2.
